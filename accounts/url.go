// It is a simplified version of url.URL, with the important limitations (which
// are considered features here) that it contains value-copyable components only,
// as well as that it doesn't do any URL encoding/decoding of special characters.
//
// The former is important to allow an account to be copied without leaving live
// references to the original version, whereas the latter is important to ensure
// one single canonical form opposed to many allowed ones by the RFC 3986 spec.
//
// As such, these URLs should not be used outside of the scope of an Ethereum
// wallet or account.
